        <p>I worked in commerce for many years, but I've always enjoyed doing things related to websites.
           I decided to take a course and graduated from the Lemon School of Programming.
            After that, I wanted to take another JavaScript course and change careers.
             But in February a war broke out in my country and I lost my job. 
             I have completed many online courses and at the moment I am looking for a new job.
              I love learning and discovering new doors. I like to work a lot and get quality results of my work!
